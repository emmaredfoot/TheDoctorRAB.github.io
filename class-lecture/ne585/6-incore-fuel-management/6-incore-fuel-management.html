# NE585
## NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE ANALYSIS
### Incore fuel management 

#### 6
---
# Outcomes for the lecture

Understanding how fuel is managed in the core for maximum burnup

Chapter 6 in the book 
---
# Then the author says there's no real meaning to 'fuel management'

The main component of fuel management is access to nuclear materials

Analyzing fuel performance in the core

Power history of the reactor

Core loading

Refueling

Storage and disposal
---
# Reactor operation is constrained by operational parameters

Need sufficient reactivity

Core needs reactivity control

Refueling needs to be during period of low demand

Fast neutron flux on the RPV should be reduced 

Why? 
---
# There are also several regulatory constraints 

Peak to average power ratio

Maximum core temperature

Deviation from nucleate boiling

Core reactivity

Temperature coefficient 
---
# Fuel cost needs to be minimized

Though it's not a huge expense

Back in the 1950s, federal government was to buy reactor produced Pu to use in breeders  

Plants also thought that the government was going to take back used fuel after 5 years

So there was only limited onsite storage

Also assumed reprocessing

Wow they were optimistic
---
# The federal government issued a [GESMO](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0710/ML071000110.pdf) in the 70s which is a stupid acronym

It stands for Generic environmental impact statement for mixed oxide fuel

The idea was that there were going to be a lot of reprocessing facilities

AEC concluded based on study from 1957 to 1972 that "widescale use of mixed oxide fuel should be approved"

Published in August 1974 - became the NRC in 1975
---
# [Carter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/10/01/why-doesnt-u-s-recycle-nuclear-fuel/#d8c1550390f1) canceled reprocessing in 1977

Thanks, Obama. 

The idea was the risk of Pu diversion

Even though USA is a nuclear weapons state

But he wanted other nations to follow suit

Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, but there wasn't any other investment

Carter cited it not being cost effective 

But the report indicated starting soon that it would be

There's also been zero cases of civilian diversion to start a weapons program
---
# We even have [Carter's](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7316) speech

The benefits of nuclear power are thus very real and practical. But a serious risk accompanies worldwide use of nuclear power--the risk that components of the nuclear power process will be turned to providing atomic weapons.

First, we will defer indefinitely the commercial reprocessing and recycling of the plutonium produced in the U.S. nuclear power programs. From our own experience, we have concluded that a viable and economic nuclear power program can be sustained without such reprocessing and recycling.

Third, we will redirect funding of U.S. nuclear research and development programs to accelerate our research into alternative nuclear fuel cycles which do not involve direct access to materials usable in nuclear weapons.

Yet you're still burning Pu in the reactors anyway
---
# Without reprocessing, plants were running out of storage space

Redesign pools to rack more fuel

Extend the burn cycle to 24 months 

Higher burnup fuels to 50 GWD/MTU

Requires higher enrichment so increased costs because SWU is intensive

Roses are red  
Violets are blue  
No one likes nuclear  

Because we use SWU
---
# Nuclear waste policy act (1982, 1987) addressed storage issue

Among the other issues about siting a repository

DOE obligated to take used fuel from plants for final disposal  

If plant needs storage space before government can take the fuel, interim storage must be provided

Utilities paid $0.001/kWh to the Nuclear Waste Fund

Since 1983, more than [$30 billion collected](https://www.nei.org/Knowledge-Center/Nuclear-Statistics/Costs-Fuel,-Operation,-Waste-Disposal-Life-Cycle/Nuclear-Waste-Fund-Payment-Information-by-State) - suspended in [May 2014](https://www.nei.org/News-Media/News/News-Archives/What-NARUC-Sees-on-the-Nuclear-Waste-Fee-Suspensio)

[NEI Urges DOE, OMB to Address Nuclear Waste Fund Inequities](https://www.nei.org/News-Media/News/News-Archives/2017/NEI-Urges-DOE,-OMB-to-Address-Nuclear-Waste-Fund-I)

# Not core management, but extending operating license to keep plants going 

While many plants did get [license renewals](https://www.nrc.gov/images/reading-rm/doc-collections/maps/power-reactors-license-renewals.png), there's still closures

[Status of License Renewal Applications and Industry Activities](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications.html)

Then we have to worry about instrumentation and control upgrades because Radio Shack closed

RPV suffers radiation damage from neutron bombardment

Why does this happen?

Low leakage core management strategies were developed
---
# Core has assemblies with different initial enrichments

Batch = group of assemblies of same fuel type and enrichment

So core is reloaded by batch

$B \equiv \frac{P_0 \cdot \epsilon \cdot T}{M(t)}$

$\epsilon \equiv \frac{\int_0^T P(t) dt}{P_0 T}$

So burnup is proportional to initial of enrichment of fuel  
But we knew that
---
# Initial reactivity is also proportional to enrichment

$\rho \equiv \frac{k-1}{k}$

Once the reactor starts operating, negative reactivity increases due to poisons

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{200}&space;\rho_{net}&space;=&space;\rho_{fuel}-\rho_{FP}-\rho_T" title="\rho_{net} = \rho_{fuel}-\rho_{FP}-\rho_T" />

Not sure this is precise enough  
What's missing?

Positive reactivity decreases linearly with time

$\rho = \rho_0-aB$
---
# What is net reactivity at critical?

That's where the control rods come in

Reactivity control from boric acid, control rods

Boron is removed from coolant over the cycle

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{200}&space;\rho_{net}&space;=&space;\rho_{fuel}-\rho_{FP}-\rho_T" title="\rho_{net} = \rho_{fuel}-\rho_{FP}-\rho_T" />

Reactivity swing is the positive reactivity in the core available during operation

Should be minimal because you don't want to have to use the control rods to suck up all the neutrons
---
# Cores operate on multiple batches

This changes reactivity calculations  
Operator needs to know real-time reactivity though

For the one batch core: $\rho_1(t) = \rho_0[1-\frac{B_1^1(t)}{B(T)}]$

$\rho_0$ is fresh fuel reactivity for unburned core

$\rho_1(t)$ is the time dependent reactivity at t

$B_N^n(t)$ is burnup of a batch at cycle n in the N-batch core at t

$B(T)$ is final burnup in the core at end of life

[So $\rho_1(T) = 0$](img/core_one.batch.jpg)
---
# Use of multiple batches reduces the reactivity swing

The book is terrible at explaining this

Assume the total core reactivity is the average of the batch reactivities

$\rho_2(t)=\frac{\rho_0}{2}[(1-\frac{B_2^1(t)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{B_2^2(t)}{B(T)})]$   
$\rho_3(t)=\frac{\rho_0}{3}[(1-\frac{B_3^1(t)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{B_3^2(t)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{B_3^3(t)}{B(T)})]$

Assume equal fractional contribution of burnup in each batch

$\rho_2(T)=\frac{\rho_0}{2}[(1-\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{B_2(T)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{2}{2}\cdot\frac{B_2(T)}{B(T)})]$     
$\rho_3(T)=\frac{\rho_0}{3}[(1-\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{B_3(T)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{B_3(T)}{B(T)})+(1-\frac{3}{3}\cdot\frac{B_3(T)}{B(T)})]$
---
# And increases burnup

With $\rho_N(T)=0$

$B_2(T)=\frac{4}{3}B(T)$

$B_3(T)=\frac{3}{2}B(T)$

PWRs go on 3 batches

BWRs, 4
---
# The core has to be loaded to fall within safety constraints

But there are operational goals

Fuel needs to achieve a certain burnup

Flat power profile across the core - low peak:average power

But then the book just says go look at these 22 references  

Thanks 

It's an optimization problem
---
#[Core loading strategies](http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/27/002/27002175.pdf) typically assume equilibrium

cycle 1 - b{1,0},b{2,0},b{3,0}

0 = fresh fuel

cycle 2 - b{2,1},b{3,1},b{4,0}

cycle 3 - b{3,2},b{4,1},b{5,0}

cycle 4 - b{4,2},b{5,1},b{6,0}

cycle 5 - b{5,2},b{6,1},b{7,0}

# Out-In core loading applies concentric regions

<img align="left" src="img/core_out.in.jpg">

Painstakingly drawn by hand

Innermost fuel discharged 

Other batches moved to center

Fresh fuel always on the end 

What does this tell us?

Not used anymore
---
# In the scatter loading, the core is divided into small regions

<img align="left" src="img/core_scatter.jpg">

Also painstakingly drawn #CommitmentToVandalEducation

Assemblies with highest burnup replaced with fresh fuel

What advantages does this configuration offer?
---
# The pressure vessel suffers damage from neutron leakage

Function of power generated and flux shape  
What shape is angular flux?  
Reduce flux without reducing power

Placed burned assemblies on the periphery  
Relocate assemblies from structural critical points  
Replace some peripheral assemblies with empty ones  
Add attenuating materials between core and vessel  
Or add more poisons to peripheral positions  

Not sure how some of those not reducing power
---
# The low leakage configuration moves fresh fuel from vessel

<img align="left" src="img/core_low.leak.jpg">

Reducing leakage increases burnup

Moves peak power closer to center

Use of poisons dependent on plant to maintain peak:average

Each with different enrichments, on different cycles
---
# Better fuel utilization will achieve higher burnup

Switch to the 18, 24 month cycle

Requires higher enrichment

Reduction in rod worth due to more Pu mass with higher enrichment

Pu increases fast:thermal flux

Control rods absorb mainly thermal neutrons
---
# Increased burnup affects structural materials 

Increased fission gas production

More radiation damage from fast neutrons 

"Increased risk of fuel failure" 

Though I would question by how much since this isn't happening
---
# It's not clear what the effect of higher burnup on fuel pools is

The book implies that neutron multiplication would be higher per assembly

There would be more Pu generated

But there would be more fission product poisons too

And the fuel would be more fissioned out 

Obviously, there needs to be an accurate measurement to ensure criticality safety
---
# Burnup is measured in a variety of ways

Direct measurement - sensors, fission chambers, flux wires - during operation

Indirect measurement - after discharge  
$^{137}Cs$ activity $B=a+bA_{Cs}$  
Directly measures 662 keV gamma, so must be accurate

Relative measurement  
$B=c(e,r)+d(e,r) \cdot \frac{^{134}Cs}{^{137}Cs}$  
e = enrichment; r = power rating

$B=ae^{b\ln{R_0}}$, $R_0=\frac{^{106}Ru\cdot ^{137}Cs}{^{134}Cs^2}$  
Good for fresh fuel because of short Ru half-life
---
# [NUREG/CR-6998](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1002/ML100210543.pdf) Table 3.1

Cs-137 direct measurement  
Insensitive to variations in reactor power rating +  
Requires well defined geometry between detector and assembly -

Cs-134:Cs-137  
Insensitive to geometry +  
Short half life, less then 20 y cooling time
Dependent on inital enrichment, power rating -  

Ru  
Insensitive to geometry +  
Less than 9 years cooling time
---
# Passive neutron measurement can also be used

Cm-244 spontaneous neutron emission dominant source  
95% after 10 years  
92% after 20 years

Uniform signal from all pins +  
Good for safeguards +  

Strong function initial enrichment -  
Geometry sensitive -  
Affected by poisons -

# Refueling needs to get done as quickly as possible 

Lots of activities going on during shutdown  
Emma Redfoot - Diablo internship

Maintenance and refueling 

Schedule shutdown during time of low demand

Where does the power come from during shutdown? 

When would be peak demand in Idaho?  
If we actually had a reactor
---
# Outages cost a lot of money

Up to 1 million dollars  
Minimize shutdown period (based on experience)  
Which lends to the question, how with SMRs do it?

Then the utility may have to buy replacement power

Establish outage organization  
Inventory of tasks to perform (12,000)  
Schedule all of the tasks

Requires expertise in risk management and decision making
